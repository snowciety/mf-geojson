mf-geojson
==========

This project contains the following:

* A library/implementation for GeoJSON tiles in [mapsforge](http://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/)
* An Android application showing how the GeoJSON library can be used


# The GeoJSON library
This implementation is based on the ["rewrite"](http://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/source/browse/?name=rewrite) branch of mapsforge. It adds the ability to use GeoJSON tiles together with mapsforge. The implementation is a bit rough around the edges and is more of a proof of concept.


# The Android Application
Uses OpenStreetMap.us vector tiles as described here: http://openstreetmap.us/~migurski/vector-datasource/
